---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------Github Branches------------------
1. Main/master branch
	Codebase residing in the master branch is considered to be production-ready

2. Feature/topic branch
	When you start working on a new feature/bug fix, you should create a feature/topic branch. 
	A feature/topic branch is normally created off a develop/integration branch. 
	This feature/topic branch can reside in your local machine throughout the entire development lifecycle of the feature.
	You will push this branch to the remote repository whenever you are ready to merge the change set with the develop/integration branch. 

3. Release branch
	When you roll out a new release, you create a release branch
	release branch names normally start with the prefix "release-".
	When you are ready to release, merge the release branch with the master branch and tag a release number to the newly created merge commit.
	You should also merge the release branch with the develop/integration branch 
	so that both the master and develop/integration branches receive the latest changes/bug fixes from the release branch.

4. Hotfix branch
	When you need to add an important fix to your production codebase quickly, you can create a Hotfix branch off the master branch.
	By convention, hotfix branch names normally start with the prefix "hotfix-".
	A hotfix branch should be merged with the develop/integration branch as well.

5. Develop/Integration branch
	A develop/integration branch should be kept stable at all times. 
	This is important because new branches are created off of this branch, and this branch could eventually go out live on production.

------------------------Provisioning Sandbox--------------------
- When a request mail comes send out an acknowledgement mail with 'To'=CC lead who mailed and place the incoming mail to your/Jerry/Anuj's folder
- On 14th or 29th raise the sandbox by running the pipeline as mentioned in the doc
- Max life os sandbox is 28 days
  **we provide sandbox for req like hive hackathon, currently it is provisioned till 31 may. Details are in Hive mail
- Once the sandbox is created, you will be able to see it under resource groups in azure portal
- Send out a sandbox proviseioned mail with 'To'= all the users mentioned in the request template and 'CC'=Rishi,Jerry and CC lead who requested
***Note that even if there are multiple sandbox requests, you will create only 1 sandbox and assign all the members to the AAD group
So cases that the user can get to access other services too which were not part of his request are fine
Also if a req comes after sandbox is provisioned and that service is not already included, you can add the service manually in the resource grp

Also the sandbox owner is Julio, so we need his approval mail
Approval mail and Sandbox setup doc in KT 6 mail
FAQ and how to access SB docs in KT mail 5

**ETSOM team which is part of ITSO team manages sandbox
Julio leads it and Hubert works for him

**There are 3 platforms – Dna, Azure@shell (sandbox which we create comes under this) and HAHS

----------------------Natural Meetings-----------------
Meeting with other teams outside IDA - teams like ITSO

It used to be monthly but now as there is reorg in Aug, it is stopped
Need to prepare decks for the meeting by first discussing with Rishi
Sample decks in KT mail 3

HSSE – Is for mental well being, Shell has high priority for this
	At the start of every natural meeting, one of the HSSE topic is discussed

----------------------Power BI CICD POC---------------------
-Earlier sharepoint was being used for version controlling of PBI reports
-But here the limitation is that multiple users cant work on the asme report at a given time
-So they moved to Github
-However Github doesnt support diffing, so CICD using github directly is not possible
-So Sherin suggested to store PBI in github and create CICD pipelines using Azure devops
-But to connect 2 services, we need SPN i.e. service principle either using certificate 

Also in parallel she has asked Stephen if we can achieve the same using itActions

1. 1 day before the expiry of sandox, create log activity and cost analysis report
   Currently it is a manual process in which we are mainitaining excel file in sharepoint
  That excel file is created manually - 1st sheet to store sandbox details, 2nd sheet for services provisioned, 3rd for cost and 4th for log
   I think we can automate it as below - using adf. store the details in sql or ecel 

2. For Rishi - at end of every quarter give report to show devkit doc published so that he can publish to yammer

3. For Dusty - at end of every quarter give report to show best user of Neo for the quarter
